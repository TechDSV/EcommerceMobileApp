If you already have a Digital E-Commerce Product, you definitely know that appropriate design and customer-centred UX means a lot to the success of your business.

* You already have an E-Commerce Business but now you decided to create an Application and want to make sure that it has a right and up-to-date mobile app interface design.
* You have an E-Commerce Mobile App or Website that was developed some time ago and now needs to be updated to meet the latest Design Trends in order to raise your Sales.

In this article, we’re going to give you 5 helpful [B2B eCommerce](https://www.designveloper.com/en/blog/what-is-b2b-ecommerce/) app design tips from our UX-wizards that will help you to increase your key business metrics: conversion, add-to-cart and other rates.

## 1. Put All Key Elements in the Thumb-Friendly Zone

Appropriate placement of elements can encourage users to take specific actions or to complicate this journey for your audience. Therefore, check if all of your key elements are located in the thumb-friendly zone.

The key idea here is simple: if people can’t easily reach something, many of them won’t even make an effort. By the way, the same rules apply to mobile-friendly websites.

* Add to the cart from the product screen.
* Proceed to the payment screen from the cart screen.
* Pay at the payment screen.

## 2. The Three-Tap Rule

When designing an eCommerce mobile app or website, it’s important to keep its structure clear. To meet this requirement, you can arrange your products in the following order: Categories, Sub-categories, Products.

As users type in the first letters, a number of possible options and suggestions to choose from will be displayed. Thus, you will not only save users time and improve their Buyer Journey but will be able to show some hot picks up front.

## 3. Avoid Long Sign Up and Checkout Process

Generally, never ever ask your client to sign up before you really need their personal information for the checkout. And even when you ask him for his information during the checkout, try to keep it as simple as possible and ask only the information which you critically need, it should fit into the screen of his smartphone without scrolling.

People find a long multi-page signup or checkout process boring. They just don’t have the patience for this, especially mobile app users. Using social media has an additional advantage. Your users might enjoy:

* Reading other people’s reviews.
* Looking at who else got this product.
* Sharing what they buy.
* Seeing that someone else, especially someone you know bought your product already increases the client’s commitment to purchase it.

## 4. Stick to the Minimalist Design

The simpler your interface is, the more likely it’s for your clients to find exactly the product they were looking for, so avoid UI-Junk. While working on the eCommerce app UI design, think about your first-time users. Your app shouldn’t have complicated guidelines and instructions for use.

* ***Use simple color schemes:*** The best solution is to go with a monochromatic or analogous scheme. To get the monochromatic color scheme you need to modify the brightness and saturation of a single hue.
* ***Use only one typeface:*** Any professional [mobile app design](https://www.designveloper.com/en/blog/top-5-mobile-app-design-tools/) company will tell you that it’s not recommended to use more than 1 typeface in the application. For that purpose, we’d advise playing with the size, style, and weight of the chosen typeface, instead of using another font.
* ***Pay attention to spacing:*** Lines and dividers are well-known tools for delineating different sections on a screen. Instead, try using shadows, colors and spacing to define different sections in a non-intrusive manner.

## 5. All Eyes on Consistency

To put it short, we can say that the eCommerce app UI design is consistent when similar elements behave and look the same way. Keeping your Product consistent is one of the most common mobile app design tips. Actually, it’s one of the key principles of design.

Consistency can be split into 3 parts:

* Functional consistency: interactive elements should work the same on different screens.
* Visual consistency: buttons, typefaces, and color schemes should look the same.
* External consistency: all your products.

Applying principles of consistency to your products will provide your customers with remarkable benefits:

* Consistency creates a logical structure of your application and eliminates confusion.
* Consistency makes your app more predictable to users. It means they won’t have to learn new ways to use your application or navigate within it.
* When users can easily manage what’s under their thumbs, it provides them with the sweet feeling of accomplishment. Naturally, it will evoke a positive emotional response and leave them even more satisfied with your products.
